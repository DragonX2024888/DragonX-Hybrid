# DragonX Hybrid: Deflationary NFTs

## Introduction

DragonX Hybrid introduces a significant innovation in the TitanX ecosystem, offering a unique blend of digital token trading and NFT technology.

This fusion of traditional cryptocurrency trading with the dynamic world of NFTs aims to provide a more engaging and flexible trading experience.

- **Enables trading of DragonX (and TitanX as TitanX can be traded for DragonX) on secondary NFT markets.**

## Core Mechanics

The creation of DragonX Hybrid NFTs involves using DragonX tokens, accompanied by a minting fee paid in TitanX. The mint fee is sent to the DragonX vault, contributing to the compounding mechanism of the DragonX ecosystem. Minting creates a unique NFT and locks the DragonX tokens in the DragonX hybrid bridge contract. Users can reclaim the DragonX represented in their NFTs by burning the NFT, a process that requires them to have a certain amount of liquid DragonX for the burn fee. Importantly, this burn fee, once paid, is permanently locked in the DragonX Hybrid bridge, effectively reducing the circulation of DragonX tokens and enhancing their scarcity.

- **Creation of NFTs requires DragonX tokens and a TitanX minting fee.**
- **Burning NFTs requires liquid DragonX tokens.**

## Scarcity and Value

Due to the deflationary nature of DragonX, the process of minting NFTs becomes progressively more challenging, thereby increasing their intrinsic value over time. This also enhances the value of the underlying DragonX tokens, as they are locked within the NFTs. Moreover, this approach effectively reduces the sell pressure on DragonX, thereby bolstering the effectiveness of the buy and burn strategy and elevating the overall value of the token.

- **Locking DragonX in NFTs reduces market sell pressure.**

## Community and Distribution

The growing DragonX holder base and the broadening distribution of tokens incrementally elevate the complexity of NFT minting. This integration of NFT and token markets establishes a dual liquidity mechanism, thereby imparting deflationary properties to the NFTs and enriching the ecosystem.

- **Creates a dual liquidity channel, enhancing the deflationary nature of NFTs.**

## Solving Trust

The DragonX Hybrid model adeptly addresses the trust challenges in over-the-counter (OTC) transactions for both DragonX and TitanX, as TitanX can be traded for DragonX, while also effectively managing slippage issues. The immutable recording of every OTC deal on the blockchain heightens security and transparency. Additionally, the tight coupling of NFTs with DragonX tokens through the bridge ensures a parallel movement in their prices, opening new arbitrage opportunities within the TitanX/DragonX ecosystem.
